## About

This is a codebase that will allow energy.gov users to quickly get started developing new graphics and maps. By cloning this repo, you can immidiately begin coding. 

This app frame is built using the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) responsive framework. If you're looking for the original, pull down [the App_Frame repository](https://github.com/energyapps/app_frame).


NOTE TO SELF, MUST DO MUCH UPDATING OF THIS README IN THE CONTENTS SECTION.

## Dependencies
- Download and install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) is already installed within this repository

## Setup

- Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/energyapps/app-frame-foundation.git`

- Rename the folder to your project name
- On the [EnergyApps Github group](https://github.com/energyapps) create and name a new project repo.
- cd into that folder in terminal and change remote URL to new repo:

`git remote -v` List all remote urls

`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/energyapps/NEW-REPO-NAME.git` -changes the remote url to your new URL

- Push to this new repo

`git push -u origin master`

- Begin work in the `index.html` file.
- Build the Jekyll _site/ folder by running `jekyll build`
- Run the jekyll server by running `jekyll serve`. You can now see your page at `http://localhost:4000/`
- Optional: Update Readme to reflect your current project.

## Contents

1.	HTML
	* default.html
		- This is the HTML testing template for local development.
		- This is a very rough cannibalization of the DOM elements in energy.gov/maps element.
		- Eventually we may be able to auto merge the JS, DOM, CSS into this using jekyll to create static views of our projects in development.
	* index.html
		- Working index that combines all of the following markup, js, and css files. Find it at [energyapps.github.com/budget_production](energyapps.github.com/budget_production)
	* markup.html
		- Markup that would be pasted in the maps content type, i.e. anything that goes within the "map" frame.
2. JS
	* Dependent Libraries (These already are added automatically into the maps content type through the dropdown menu)
		- currently empty
	* Data.js
		- Data for the map in json objects. This would be added to the maps content type.
	* Script
		- script that executes all commands on graphic. This would be added to the maps content type.
3. CSS
	* style.css
		- custom css to be added to map. CSS that would be added to the maps content type.
	* links to external, master energy.gov css styles
		- note these break often
	* master_style.css
		- A static copy of the above as a fallback when the energy.gov links break.

## Needs/Ideal Work flow

	- You will create your content in markup.html, data.js, script.js, and style.css.
	- These files will then be merged into the default.html using Jekyll pages.
